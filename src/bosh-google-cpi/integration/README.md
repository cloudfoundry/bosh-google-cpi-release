# Integration Testing
Running integration tests requires a Google Compute Engine project with billing enabled. It creates real resources and costs real money to run.

## Configure your project
Run the `configint` target with your project specified to provision the resources required to run integration tests. For example:

```
$ make configint GOOGLE_PROJECT=my-test-project
```

This will provision several networks, a subnetwork, and a static external IP address. It is **important** to note that the IP address is a billable resource. To minimize charges, you can use `gcloud` to manually delete the address after tests have run.

## Run integration
Use the `testint` target to run integration tests.

### All tests
This command will run all possible integration tests, and may take close to an hour to complete:

```
$ GOOGLE_PROJECT=evandbrown17 GINKGO_ARGS=-ginkgo.focus=Stemcell make testint
```

Finally, you can pass arguments to Ginkgo. To run only the stemcell tests, set the focus:

```
$ GOOGLE_PROJECT=evandbrown17 GINKGO_ARGS=-ginkgo.focus=Stemcell make testint
```
